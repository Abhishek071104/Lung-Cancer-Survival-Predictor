# Lung-Cancer-Survival-Predictor
Lung Cancer Survival Prediction using Machine Learning This project uses patient medical records and treatment history to predict lung cancer survival using a Random Forest Classifier. The solution includes data preprocessing, model training with SMOTE for imbalance handling, and an interactive Streamlit UI for real-time predictions.
